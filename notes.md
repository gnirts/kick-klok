pattern mode 
* create a blank pattern on the 404
* start pattern when start msg recv
* see if it can last several songs

fx
* create arduino function that can increase CC value over time
* pick which effects are musical
* define the pads/conditions for activating them
* map drum velocity onto fx intensity (this will be a general pattern)

pitch stuff-
chromatic mode (midi channel 16) midi notes 36–60 (C2–C4)
true voice: 12–91 (C0–G6, MIDI mode B) 


click track
* test if 404 click can come only out of phones
* test if 404 click is sync'd with midi
* find a way to sync DTX clock with TR8
* output a click on the audio board

playability
* adjust pad level while robin is playing: need midi mute
* adjust fx params while robin is playing: novation?
* put 404 in remote mode: tempo recvieved from TR8


TR8 clock, start, stop --> SP404


Note Routing Heuristics 
 - velocity
 - user switched
    - pedal
 - per song basis

things 404 could do
- low probability accents
- momentary fx applied to DTX audio
- automated fx applied to DTX audio
- chopped breaks

automate starting 404 pattern mode clock
at the same time the start message comes from the TR8



send ch16 404 back to itself
send clock from tr8 to 303
send clock from tr8 to MF 



breaks on to 404
    - current bbx 6.4 
    - i can't wait
    - 

vocals on to 404
    - original circuit boy
    - danger capitalism
    - vaginal davis UGH
    - blah blah blah
    - bitch knew i'd be back

effects settings macros
    - start slicer on bus1 with given offset from bar start
    - allow adjusting offset by 100, 10, 1
    - put DJFX looper on BUS2
    - activate loop at certain intervals
    - vary loop length

start pattern on 404
play pad on 404
do above synced to TR8 clock / program start
restart with program start
stop with program stop
