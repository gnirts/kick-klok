pattern mode 
* create a blank pattern on the 404
* start pattern when start msg recv
* see if it can last several songs

fx
* create arduino function that can increase CC value over time
* pick which effects are musical
* define the pads/conditions for activating them
* map drum velocity onto fx intensity (this will be a general pattern)

pitch stuff
chromatic mode (midi channel 16) midi notes 36–60 (C2–C4)
true voice: 12–91 (C0–G6, MIDI mode B) 


click track
* test if 404 click can come only out of phones
* test if 404 click is sync'd with midi
* find a way to sync DTX clock with TR8
* output a click on the audio board

playability
* adjust pad level while robin is playing: need midi mute
* adjust fx params while robin is playing: novation?
* put 404 in remote mode: tempo recvieved from TR8


TR8 clock, start, stop --> SP404
